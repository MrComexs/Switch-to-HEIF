## Background
 This repo is to see if its a good fit for you or your family so what is HEIF or also know as High Efficiency Image Formate is replacement for jpg. From my testing, HEIF images save about 3/4 to 1/3 compared to jpg. Thought you will sometimtes lose a very small about of detail but not very noticable unless if you zoom in to look a every pixel. Before we take about specifics I would recommend looking at the charts below to see if the apps you use support HEIF. If you don't send images though any messaging apps then move pass the charts. 
### Supported Android apps

## History 

## Should You switch
I think you should switch over if these bullets point represent you.
- Takes a lot of Photos
- Forgets to delete photos
- Doesn't mind saving storage with a very minimal difference it quality compared to jpg
## Should you switch Person *X*
the same as the chart before
I think you should switch over if these bullets point represent you.
- Takes a lot of Photos
- Forgets to delete photos
- Doesn't mind saving storage with a very minimal difference it quality compared to jpg
## Conclusion
you should switch over. As long as you don't care the the very minimal quality gains of jpg.

## todo
- switching existing images over to HEIF
- add sample images to compare the difference of the two
- finish both charts
- add more apps
- talk more about supported devices.
- talk about webp as a alternative
